%MATLAB ship simulator by Jason Koch and Julian Pryde

% Take ship characteristics (turn radius at specific rudder angles, forard and aftward acceleration)

% Define drag deceleration as function of velocity

% create random set and drift

% Take initial course, speed, position, 

% create uncertainty factor for course and speeds

% display menu: take fix, end program, set new course and speeds

% If take fix:
	% display current coordinates
	
	% stamp log file with time/perceived course and speed/coordinates
	
	% stamp array log with time/actual course and speed/coordinates

% If set new course and speeds
	% Stamp both logs with coordinates and shit

	% function [end turn time, end turn coords] = turnSim(rud angle, true speed, true course, coords, perceived course, percieved speed)
	
	% create new uncertainty factor
	
	% @#$%^&* swear profusely at user
	
	% calculate duration of change 
	
	% print "changing course and/or speed" for duration of change
	
	% replace course, speed, coords and time with new values
	
	% stamp dem logs

% If end program
	%...	
	
	% No Stopping!
	
	% return to top of program
	
	% If Ctrl+C then restart program
	
	% If power button pressed then restart program
	
	% If computer smashed with hammer then restart program on different computer
	
	% is no escape.
	
	% is no end.
	
	% SWO life or NO life.
